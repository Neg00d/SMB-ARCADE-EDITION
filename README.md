# Super-Mario-Bros.-ARCADE-EDITION
ROM-Hack/IPS-Patch for Super Mario Bros. (World)

Have you ever wondered what Super Mario Bros. would look like if the NES hadn't existed? Here's my own answer to that question!

NEW:
+ start with only one life
+ less time to traverse stages
+ new (partially humorous) text & UI
+ overall faster physics
+ different color palettes
+ updated power-ups
+ differnet score values
+ enemies are far more aggressive
+ MASTER MODE!!!
+ water stages are actually fun now
+ Luigi was named to Lario

This ROM-Hack gives you the feeling of playing for your inserted coins, so every life counts - don't skip any stages, actually unless you're a extremly talented SMB-player of course ;P!
