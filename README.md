# SMB-ARCADE-EDITION (1.0)
ROM-Hack/IPS-Patch for Super Mario Bros. (World)

NEW: Super Mario Bros. ARCADE PLUS now available!
This updated version includes a small graphic overhaul and 8 new levels. However, you can still choose to play the version with original 32 stages instead!

+ start with only one life
+ less time to traverse stages
+ new (partially humorous) text & UI
+ overall faster physics
+ different color palettes
+ updated power-ups
+ differnet score values
+ enemies are far more aggressive
+ MASTER MODE!!!
+ Luigi still named Lario
  
This ROM-Hack gives you the feeling of playing for your inserted coins, so every life counts - don't skip any stages, actually unless you're a extremly talented SMB-player of course ;P!
